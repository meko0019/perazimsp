			<i>Now the day before Saul came, the Lord had revealed this to Samuel: “About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over my people Israel; he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked on my people, for their cry has reached me.” When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the Lord said to him, “This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people.” </i> <br> <br>
			Have you ever wondered what your purpose was? Or What God made you to do. Figuring out what college, major, job, or even what spouse is right for you can be stressful. Answering life’s biggest question can be difficult because we all want what’s best for us. As believers we believe that God has reserved the best for us. What if I told you, God cares more about who you are, than what you do? <br> 
			You see when we study the scriptures we see two different types of the will of God. </p> <div class = "quotes"> <i>"What if I told you, God cares more about who you are, than what you do?"</i> </div> <p>There is the sovereign will of God. This is the will that God hasn’t told us, but is revealed in time. For example, by reading the scriptures one cannot figure out what college to enroll into. However there is another type of will, which is the revealed will of God. This is the will that God has made plain to us such as obedience, loving one another, forgiving one another, loving and honoring our parents and so on.  <br> <br>
			Remember how Saul became king over the nation of Israel? His father had lost some of the cattle, and sheep, and had asked his son Saul to go look for them. Now what Saul did was key, he obeyed. He could have easily told his father to ask one of the servants to do it. He could have disobeyed, and simply not have done it. However in his obedience to his fathers command, he ran into Samuel who told him that he was called by God to be the king.
			Now I don’t know about you, but I think this is pretty intense. Saul in a millions of years wouldn’t have expected what was awaiting him. The key is obedience. I like to think of the Nike slogan when I think of obedience, “just 	do it.” God has given us the Holy Spirit to equip us to say yes to things of God. Too often we equate obedience with God robbing us of life. Jesus said I have come to give you life and life to the fullest. God is for our joy. He is for our pleasure, and enjoyment of life. <br> </p>
			<div class = "quotes2"> <i> "The biggest lie we can believe is that God isn’t enough" </i>	</div> <p>
			 God created us, so he knows how we best function. When God calls us to obey him, he is calling us to life. Most people look at the bible as a rulebook, or to do list. But that isn’t the case. The biggest lie we can believe is that God isn’t enough. Psalm 16:11 says, “You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.” John Piper said it best; “Christ is most glorified in you, when you are most satisfied in him.” To obey is to be satisfied in the ultimate pleasure, Jesus!  <br> <br>
			In the same regard, as we obey our father God, he will lead us into the college, job, or spouse we ought to marry, because the pleasure of purpose takes a back seat to the pleasure of knowing God. If you find yourself confused as to what your purpose is, ask yourself how well you are following the revealed the will of God. In becoming more like Jesus through obedience, we find ourselves in the center of the will of God for our lives.
