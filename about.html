        <p>Perazim is a ministry at Ethiopian Evangelical Church. It started off as a young adult ministry, but it has grown to be larger than that demographic. Perazim is a ministry that hopes to launch off to become its own church in the near future.
 
​How Perazim began is humbling and unique. About ten years ago, the youth ministry began at Ethiopian Evangelical Church. Unlike most churches the youth ministry was desperately needed due to the language and cultural gap between the parents and teenagers. By the grace and mighty hand of God, the youth ministry flourished, and was able to retain most of the youth even after they had either graduated college or, was attending college. In most churches, youth move on to attend the main service and leave the youth ministry once graduating high school. However due to the cultural and language gap this was not practical for them to do.
​
Thus Perazim was born. Its initial vision was to be a young adult ministry. However since the service is in English it has attracted members that are not young adults only. Although Perazim is a ministry of Ethiopian Evangelical Church, it serves, as its own mini church.
 
Perazim is a gospel-centered ministry. Its aim, and objective is to have its members adapt a gospel-centered worldview. We believe to be an effective Christian we must keep our faith at the center of our marriages, vocation, relationships, education, and culture.  At Perazim we believe in being purposeful in our everyday life. We aim to bring heaven down by serving and building not only our people of community, but also the world around us.
 
Perazim is the mountain King David defeated the philistines on when they rose up against him. He named the mountain Perazim because God gave him victory and breakthrough. We wanted to go with this name for out ministry because like David we are all fighting against something. We are all waging war with our flesh, and sin. Some of us are waging war with loss, sickness, financial problems; I mean the list goes on and on. However we want to stand from a place of victory believing in our victory over these things. What’s interesting about this story is that David goes to mount Perazim before fighting the battle. We are firm believers that where we fight affects the outcome of the fight. David went to the place of victory to fight his battle. It is extremely important for us to understand as believers, and as a ministry that we fight from the position of victory because we are in Christ Jesus. Our victory or breakthrough doesn’t lie in our strategies, strengths, or resources but in Christ Jesus. Jesus is our Perazim and on Him we stand to get our victory. Perazim is a ministry that believes that we aren’t meant to just survive the battle of sin, or life, but to thrive in it.</p>
