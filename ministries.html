      <p> Perazim is a ministry at Ethiopian Evangelical Church. It started off as a young adult ministry, but it has grown to be larger than that demographic. Perazim is a ministry that hopes to launch off to become its own church in the near future.
 
​How Perazim began is humbling and unique. About ten years ago, the youth ministry began at Ethiopian Evangelical Church. Unlike most churches the youth ministry was desperately needed due to the language and cultural gap between the parents and teenagers. By the grace and mighty hand of God, the youth ministry flourished, and was able to retain most of the youth even after they had either graduated college or, was attending college. In most churches, youth move on to attend the main service and leave the youth ministry once graduating high school. However due to the cultural and language gap this was not practical for them to do.

Thus Perazim was born.</p> </div>
